                                    <p>our moderators do not always have time to check each request for a meeting, but thanks to you, we can delete these accounts. You need to copy the account that you consider to be fake and write to us at â€œcharitMeetings@gmail.com". Our moderators will check this account and if they find out that the account is not real, we will take action.</p>
